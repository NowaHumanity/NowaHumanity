        <h1 class="fade-in">📜 The New Humanity Manifesto - The Path to the Future</h1>

        <p class="fade-in"><strong>It's time to change the game. Humanity needs a new path - a path that will lead us to a united, progressive, and free future.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="fade-in">🌍 Why are we here?</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            Humanity is at a historical turning point. Instead of moving forward, we are engaged in division, wars, and conservative laws that block innovation. 
            While we fight each other, our planet suffers, and our future is limited.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in">
            But there is one truth that cannot be ignored: <strong>We are all human. We share the same world. If we do not unite now - we will miss our greatest opportunity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in">It's time to transform <strong>from a collection of separate peoples - into one humanity.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="fade-in">🛡️ 6 Fundamental Principles</h2>

        <h3 class="fade-in">🚀 1. Humanity is One Entity - Not Separate Groups</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">There is no more "us against them". We are <strong>one species, and our future depends on our ability to work together.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">🌟 2. Diversity is Our Strength</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Cultures, thoughts, and creativity – that’s what makes humanity unique. Instead of fighting over differences, <strong>we will use them to evolve.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">🛠 3. From Wars to Progress</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Every dollar spent on war – could feed, heal, and launch us to the stars. It’s time to <strong>end an economy that profits from destruction and build an economy of progress.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">🤖 4. Free Technology Instead of Control</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, and quantum computing can <strong>liberate humanity – if we make sure they don’t become tools of oppression.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">🌌 5. Humanity Must Go Beyond Earth</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Our future doesn’t end here. To ensure survival and development, <strong>we must become an interstellar species.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">🔑 6. A Decentralized Economy – Freedom Through Innovation</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Existing financial systems rely on centralized control, limiting access and creating inequalities. We will establish a decentralized economy where value is driven by contribution, collaboration, and innovation. <strong>🚀 This will empower individuals and communities, ensuring financial freedom and fair opportunities for all.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="fade-in">🔥 How Do We Get Started?</h2>

        <h3 class="fade-in">1️⃣ Spread the Idea</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Talk, share, discuss. Once the thought spreads, it cannot be stopped.</p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">2️⃣ A Global Community Connected Not by Politics, but by a Common Goal</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">We will create a <strong>decentralized social network</strong> that will allow people from around the world to connect and collaborate, without corporate or government control.</p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">3️⃣ Independent, Unforced Education</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">We will create <strong>free educational platforms</strong> that will educate the next generation to think in a unified and creative way.</p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">4️⃣ Creating an Unstoppable Global Currency</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">We will launch <strong>a decentralized currency</strong> that cannot be used to finance wars, control, or bribery, but only to develop technology, education, and a better future.</p>

        <h3 class="fade-in">5️⃣ Decentralized Movement – It Cannot Be Stopped</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">We are not an organization or a country. <strong>We are a community of people who understand that it is time for change.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="fade-in">🌟 The Next Step – It Is in Your Hands</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            The world will not change by itself. <strong>It depends on us, on people who are willing to think differently, share, and start acting.</strong>
        </p>
